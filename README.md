<p> Regarding to JavaScript, it shows how creative we can be with simple functions, conditions, directions and positions. Obviously, we can always do better, that's why I am willing to keep working on this soon. I intend to look for improvemnts about extra aspects such as score, highscore, speed, colours.<p>
